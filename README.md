# Airplane-Crash-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global plane crash data, focusing on temporal trends, geospatial distribution, operator performance, aircraft involvement, and fatality trends. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of plane crashes over the years and highlights key insights related to safety, operational performance, and aircraft reliability.

## Project Aim
The primary aim of this analysis is to uncover significant patterns and trends in plane crashes, offering insights into temporal evolution, geographical distribution, operator performance, aircraft involvement, and fatality rates. The insights are intended to inform strategies for improving aviation safety and reducing future incidents.

## KPIs and Metrics
- Fatality Rate: 71.86%
- Incident Rate: 0.37%
- Total Plane Crashes: 4,998
- Total Crew Fatalities: 17,023
- Total Passenger Fatalities: 90,620

## Insights

### Temporal Analysis
- The highest number of plane crashes occurred in 1946, with 88 incidents.
- 1989 saw the second-highest number of crashes, with 83 incidents.
- Another notable year was 1947, with 82 incidents.
  
### Geospatial Analysis
- Brazil has the highest incidence of plane crashes, totaling 169 incidents.
- Colombia follows closely with 148 incidents.
- France ranks third with 114 incidents.
  
### Operator Performance
- Aeroflot has the highest involvement in plane crashes, with 225 incidents.
- The US Military Air Force follows with 140 incidents.
- Air France is third, with 72 incidents.

### Aircraft Analysis
- The Douglas DC-3 ranks first in plane crashes, involved in 333 incidents.
- The De Havilland DH-4 follows with 82 crashes.
- The Douglas C47A-3 is third with 70 crashes.
  
### Fatality Trends
- The highest passenger fatalities occurred in 1985, with 1,082 deaths.
- 1972 witnessed 875 fatalities, while 1996 had 850 passenger fatalities.
-Crew fatalities peaked at 114 in 1958, followed by 135 in 1966, and 126 in 1996.

### Recommendations
- Enhance Safety Protocols: Focus on improving safety measures for aircraft models with a high crash rate, such as the Douglas DC-3.
- Operator Training: Implement stricter training and operational standards for operators with a significant crash history, such as Aeroflot and the US Military Air Force.
- Geographical Focus: Prioritize safety initiatives in regions with high incident rates, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and France.

### Learnings
This project provided valuable insights into the historical trends of plane crashes and the factors contributing to them. It highlighted the importance of safety protocols, the need for ongoing improvements in operator training, and the significance of regional safety measures. Additionally, it emphasized the critical role of aircraft maintenance and reliability in preventing future incidents.
